# Virtual Baby Groot Pet

Have you ever picked up your tamagotchi and thought:
"Gee whiz I really wish I could play this but with baby Groot from the critically acclaimed Marvels Guardians of the Galaxy"

# How to Play

Your goal is to keep Baby Groot alive until he is 15 days old and able to safely grow out of his flower pot. You'll have to manage Groots health & hunger.

# Guide

If Baby Groots fitness drops below 0 he will die!

If Baby Groots hunger is over 10 he will die!

Don't panic! Baby Groot will tell you how he is feeling.
