Have you ever picked up your tamagotchi and thought:
"Gee whiz I really wish I could play this but with baby Groot from the critically acclaimed Marvels Guardians of the Galaxy"

Well then this is the project for you!

## How to Play

---

Your goal is to keep Baby Groot alive until he is 15 days old and able to safely grow out of his flower pot.

You'll have to manage Groots health & hunger.

## Guide

---

- If Baby Groots fitness drops below 0 he will die!

- If Baby Groots hunger is over 10 he will die!

- Don't panic! Baby Groot will tell you how he is feeling.

## Project setup

---

Install Jest using `npm`:

```bash
npm install --save-dev jest
```

Add the following section to your `package.json`:

```json
"jest":{
    "testEnvironment": "jsdom"
},
{
  "scripts": {
